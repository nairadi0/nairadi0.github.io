            For this assignment, the most challenging part was figuring out Github and managing the versions of the assignment. 
            Pushing the commit to the main was also challenging as the process was confusing. Learning the basics of Github was the most
            important part of this project for me as it is very important to know for future projects. I had some prior
            knowledge of html so creating the page was not that difficult. The resources tht were most helpful were the recorded lectures
            in Canvas that allowed me to go back and review.
