            For this assignment, the most challenging part was figuring out Github and managing the versions of the assignment. 
            Pushing the commit to the main was also challenging as the process was confusing. Learning the basics of Github was the most
            important part of this project for me as it is very important to know for future projects. I had some prior
            knowledge of html so creating the page was not that difficult. The resources tht were most helpful were the recorded lectures
            in Canvas that allowed me to go back and review.

        <p>
            For this assignment, the most challenging part was figuring out the flex boxes and how to have elements wrap around the page. The items in the web page needed to be resized
            to fit the format and appear in rows. The most important part of this assignment was learning the basics of CSS and styling a web page. I had no prior experience of CSS so
            it was difficult at first. The most useful resources for this assignment were the lecture notes and videos on the course website. These allowed me to go back and review important
            content

            For this assignment, the most challenging part was figuring out the steps to set up the add item function. 
            The initial challenge revolved around making the "sell something" modal visible upon clicking the designated button. 
            Examining the HTML structure and understanding the intricacies of CSS classes were crucial steps.
            mplementing a robust filtering mechanism posed challenges, especially when considering the dynamic addition of cities. 
            Ensuring that all posts, including newly added ones, were appropriately filtered demanded attention to detail.

        <h2> 11/20/2023</h2>
        <p>
            For this assignment, the most challenging part was challenge lay in understanding and implementing the server logic to serve static content, 
            handle dynamic content generation, and appropriately respond to various URL patterns. Setting up the server to respond to different file types with the correct 
            content type headers and statuses required a meticulous examination of the Node.js built-in modules. Managing the server's response to root paths, 
            dynamic content paths (such as /posts/<n>), and handling 404 errors demanded careful consideration of URL parsing and string manipulation. 
            Additionally, ensuring that file reads were limited and each file was read only once introduced an extra layer of complexity to the implementation.
