            For this assignment, the most challenging part was figuring out Github and managing the versions of the assignment. 
            Pushing the commit to the main was also challenging as the process was confusing. Learning the basics of Github was the most
            important part of this project for me as it is very important to know for future projects. I had some prior
            knowledge of html so creating the page was not that difficult. The resources tht were most helpful were the recorded lectures
            in Canvas that allowed me to go back and review.

            For this assignment, the most challenging part was figuring out the flex boxes and how to have elements wrap around the page. The items in the web page needed to be resized
            to fit the format and appear in rows. The most important part of this assignment was learning the basics of CSS and styling a web page. I had no prior experience of CSS so
            it was difficult at first. The most useful resources for this assignment were the lecture notes and videos on the course website. These allowed me to go back and review important
            content
